# Gestalt-theory-project

In this project I continued to build on the work I did in the redesign guide. I made some tweaks to the existing pages and made a new additional page.
I added comments in the Figma to explain how Gestalt theory influenced my new design. I go on to explain why I changed some things and why I didn't according to
how they aligned with Gestalt design principles.
